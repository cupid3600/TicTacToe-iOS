TicTacToe
=========

This app is an evaluation exercise. It is a basic Tic Tac Toe game with key parts of the code missing (there is placeholder code that allows the app to compile and run, but it does not play a proper game).


Instructions:
-------------
- Search for all "TODO:" within the project and replace the indicated placeholder code with a viable solution.
- Zip the finished project, and send it back.


Notes:
------
- Candidates are welcome to modify, or improve, other parts of the code not marked with a "TODO:", but that is neither required, nor expected.
